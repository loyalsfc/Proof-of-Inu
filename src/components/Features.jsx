                    of the ledger. So, to alter any data, there must be
                    a unanimous agreement of every node. This makes
                    blockchain secure and transparent."

                    and open to the public, but the actual persons are
                    kept anonymous through the addresses. For
                    example, suppose a person sends a sum of money,
                    the receiver will know that the sender is linked to
                    a bitcoin address, but they will not know the
                    actual address. There are several reasons for
                    this â€“ one of them is privacy."
